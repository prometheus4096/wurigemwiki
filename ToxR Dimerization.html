<h1>ToxR Dimerization</h1>

<p>The ToxR system relies on the oligomerization of two membrane-bound units under influence of the presence of an antigen, which will result in a fluorescent signal. It differs from the Cpx circuit, since it uses transcription to produce a fluorescent protein rather than combine two inactive subunits. This results in a longer activation time, but it retains it modularity, specificity and is very robust. 
</p>
<p>On the extracellular side of the membrane, the construct contains an affibody which has high binding affinity for a specific antigen. Whenever that antigen is present, a certain repetitive epitope will be bound by the affibody-construct fusion present in the cellular membrane. A second construct, containing the same affibody, will eventually bind another epitope on the same antigen, which causes the two fusion constructs to approach each other. Owing to the homodimerizing capabilities of the transmembrane sequences, they will associate. On the cytoplasmic side, the ToxR domain is fused to the construct which will, after dimerization of the transmembrane sequences, dimerize as well. This dimerized form is an activating transcription factor for the ctx promoter, which will initiate transcription of the downstream GFP gene. After transcription is finished, the protein should become fluorescent, indicating the presence of the respective antigen in the provided sample.
